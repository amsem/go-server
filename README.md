# go-server
"This is a Go (Golang) implementation of a simple HTTP server that serves a form to fill out and displays the inputs on submission. This project showcases my ability to work with the net/http package, handle HTTP requests and responses, and implement basic web functionality in Go. I also applied my understanding of HTML forms and their interaction with the backend. This is a great example of my proficiency in Go language and web development, as a simple web application can be a foundation for more complex web-based systems. It can also be a nice starting point for anyone who is learning Go and web development. Feel free to use this project as a reference or starting point for your own projects."
